The Medical Fact states that pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) stimulates dopa decarboxylase, which can decrease the therapeutic effect of levodopa unless dopa decarboxylase is inhibited by carbidopa. Since carbidopa is present in the levodopa-carbidopa combination, the addition of Vitamin B6 would not affect the therapy.
