Once transferrin is saturated with iron, any that has accumulated in the mucosal cells is lost when the cells are shed. Expression of the ferropoin gene is downregulated by hepcidin, a peptide secreted by the liver when body iron reserves are adequate. In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferropoin and increased iron absorption. As a result of this mucosal barrier, only ~10% of dietary iron is absorbed, and only 1 to 5% from many plant foods.",

Visceral larvae migrans is a condition caused by infection with non-human nematodes, which is not relevant to the migration of Ascaris, Hookworm, and Strongyloides larvae. Clinical pneumonitis is a symptom that is seen only in massive infections, which is not the most common systemic symptom during the migration of these larvae. Larva migrans is a condition that can occur when humans are infected with non-human species of nematodes, but it is not the most common systemic symptom during the migration of Ascaris, Hookworm, and Strongyloides larvae.
