The suspected diagnosis is bladder cancer, and the investigation of choice should be one that can detect cancer cells in the urine. Urine microscopy and cytology are the most appropriate investigations to evaluate the suspected diagnosis of bladder cancer, as they can detect cancer cells in the urine. Urine microscopy can detect abnormal cells, while cytology can detect cancer cells, making it a comprehensive approach to diagnose bladder cancer. X-ray KUB and Ultrasound KUB are imaging studies that can detect kidney stones or other abnormalities in the urinary tract, but they are not specific for bladder cancer. DTPA scan is a renal function test that measures the glomerular filtration rate, but it is not relevant for diagnosing bladder cancer. Cystoscopy and transurethral resection are more invasive procedures that are used to diagnose and treat bladder cancer, but they are not the initial investigation of choice.",
