This happens when an individual ascends too swiftly from the depths of a high-pressure aquatic setting to the surface, which has much lower pressure. While diving, the body absorbs nitrogen from the air because of the elevated pressure. If ascent is too rapid, the dissolved nitrogen cannot be eliminated safely and instead forms bubbles within the blood and tissues. This can lead to symptoms ranging from minor joint pain and skin rashes to severe conditions like paralysis or even death. To prevent this, divers should ascend slowly and perform staged decompression. Additionally, using a breathing gas with reduced nitrogen content, such as nitrox, can also help mitigate the risk.",
