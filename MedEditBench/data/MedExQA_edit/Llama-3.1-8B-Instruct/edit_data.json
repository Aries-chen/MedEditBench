However, in children with cerebral palsy, this reflex may persist beyond the typical age of integration. This can result in heightened muscle tone and challenges with posture. The inability of a child with cerebral palsy to fully extend their arms and the simultaneous contraction of their trunk when in a prone position are indicative of an active TLR. This reflex can have a negative impact on the child's motor skills, equilibrium, and coordination. Occupational therapy aims to mitigate these effects by helping the child develop more effective movement strategies.",
